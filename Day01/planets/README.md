Introduction to GitHub & Social Coding
======================================
A cosmic description of our solar systems' celestial bodies,
to introduce the basics of the [GitHub
workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

### Activity Instructions

1. If you don't have one already, make a GitHub account
[here](https://github.com/join?source=experiment-header-dropdowns-home).
2. [Fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork)
to your account by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right-hand corner of
this page. We'll call your fork `origin`, since you're starting your own contribution
from there.
4. Make some changes to a file in this repository by editing it in the web interface.
6. [Open a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request)
to the [GT-IDEaS/Bootcamp2019 repository](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/Bootcamp2019), what
we'll call `upstream` (since your `origin` is a fork of this repository, this
repository is one "level" above your `origin`).
7. Success! 

Your pull request can be approved, returned marked for you to change, or
closed.  Whichever occurs, the changes you've proposed in your pull request
will generally be discussed among the development community and repository
owners and/or maintainers before a final decision is made. Congratulations on
your first contribution to a collaborative project on GitHub!
