IDEaS Summer Data Science Bootcamp
==================================

Data science is revolutionizing how scientists and engineers go about their
work, but most students have not had much exposure to it. This one-week
bootcamp provides an opportunity to get introduced to data management and
visualization, data modeling, deep learning, and scientific programming in
Python. The bootcamp will consist of morning lectures, followed by hands-on
sessions in the afternoon to try out and practice concepts and software tools.

The bootcamp is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students in science and
engineering who have an introductory-level familiarity with any computer
programming language, or MATLAB, or RStudio, etc. The bootcamp is free of
charge, but enrollment is capped so students must apply by May 15, 2019.
Students from Agnes Scott, Morehouse, Spelman, and Georgia Tech are
particularly encouraged to apply.

- Topics: Computer programming in Python for data science, clustering, numerical
linear algebra, classification, regression, deep learning, and domain
applications
- Tools: Python, Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,
scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
- Skills: Python programming, version control, social coding, data handling and
visualization, data analysis, data modeling and prediction, and scientific and
engineering applications
- Instructors: Ryan Wade (Blue Horseshoe Solutions), Vetria Byrd (Purdue
University), Edmond Chow (Georgia Tech), Xiaoming Huo (Georgia Tech), Eva Dyer
(Georgia Tech), Chris DePree (Agnes Scott), and David Sherrill (Georgia Tech)
